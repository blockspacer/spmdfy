# SPMDfy
A transpiler from CUDA to ISPC using clang libTooling. Some of the experiments that I had been doing can be found [here](https://github.com/schwarzschild-radius/CUDA_to_ISPC/tree/master/Experiments). The tools was developed as a part of Google Summer of Code project under CERN with [Daniel Hugo CÃ¡mpora Perez](https://github.com/dcampora) and [Axel Naumann](https://github.com/Axel-Naumann) as mentors.

## Presentations
The presentations will give you a detailed description of the project, it's motivation and future directions.

1. [1st Real Time Analysis Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R03OiA1FdFXzN0XPl7Ju8bUFLsYXEs_EeclSYPvoLi8/edit?usp=sharing)
2. [GSoC Wrapup](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k1xSH9aW-pkHbp9NXypKQpMWzgA3DO6uV_i0fnHHkbI/edit?usp=sharing)
3. [CERN Lightning Talks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kgiaZ_XcKmhLgyc6Xh83ZLXhx4D7qTJ8resB7cnS8U4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Requirements
1. CUDA 9.0 - 9.2
2. ISPC - use built in alloy.py script to install
3. clang 9 - with libclang and llvm-tools
4. CMake 3.5.0 or greater 

## Docker Image
There is a [Dockerfile](./docker) provided with the project to the ease installation process

## Build Instructions
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -G Ninja -DLLVM_DIR=path_to_llvm_cmake_dir ..

## Documentation of the Tool
Sphnix documentation of the tool can be generated by passing `docs/all` to the build system.

## Usage
    ./spmdfy ../examples/transpose/transpose.cu -o transpose.ispc

Clang uses a compilation database to pass additional command line arguments. You can generate using cmake by passing `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` which will dump `compile_commands.json`. If your codebase is compile nvcc, you can convert nvcc specific flags to clang's by running the tool [here](./tools/nvcc_to_cuda_clang.py).

## Feature List

- [x] Shared Memory - both dynamic and static
- [x] Atomic Functions
- [x] Syncthreads with complex control flow
- [x] Some CUDA Math libraries
- [x] Device Functions
- [x] Python Tool to convert compilation database

## Future Work
1. Dataflow analysis to detect partial nodes
2. Inline of Device functions
3. More C++ stuff - Convert C++ to C as ISPC is a C language.

## Tests
List of tests that are currently working with the tool.

- [x] CUDA_Features/Shared_Memory
- [x] CUDA_Features/Atomic
- [ ] Finite Difference
- [x] Transpose
- [x] Saxpy
- [x] Reduce
